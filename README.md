# Public Smoothie

This repository is the collection of personal contributions to a proprietary project named "Smoothie". Each directory is a separate repository containing only the parts I had the leisure of sharing. Some programs will not work as some necessary scripts are missing. This is just a showcase of code I have written.

## Smoothie

## Smoothie Arch ISO
